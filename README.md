# Web-scrapping
#### my first piece of python code

## Introduction 
To automate the process of web-scraping for agent information, I self-learned python and created this piece of code in a rather robust manner.
This piece of code, (according to what I still remember), uses beautiful soup for web scraping. Main framework is:
- read data from excel file;
- generate a search query corresponding to the data read;
- open first N websites, until find the key words needed using regular expression;
- assemble the retrieved information;
- iterate
